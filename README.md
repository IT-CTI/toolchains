# nerves-toolchain

This project contains the configuration and scripts used to build the
cross-compilers for the Nerves project. While pre-built toolchains exist for
various hosts and targets, they don't seem to exist for the combination
supported by Nerves. This project fills that gap.

## Linux

Install the following packages:

```
sudo apt-get install TBD
```

Run `build.sh` and wait.

## OSX

Install the following packages:

brew install libtool autoconf gnu-sed mpfr gmp gcc
brew install grep -â€”with-default-names
brew install --universal gettext
brew link --force gettext

```

## Updating ctng config files

You may need to update the `ctng` configurations if `gcc` needs to be upgraded
or the C library needs to change. The small defconfigs are stored in the
`configs` directory and expanded automatically by `build.sh` to
`work-.../build/.config`. In that directory, you can run `make menuconfig` to
change the `ctng` configuration. When you're done, run `make savedefconfig` and
copy the result to the `configs` directory.
